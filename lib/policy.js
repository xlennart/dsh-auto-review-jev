/**
 * Default reviewer system prompt: the guardian policy the reviewer applies.

 * Keep this LEAN. The reviewer makes every risk judgment; code only enforces
 * facts it can know exactly, such as strict JSON, critical never allowing,
 * and complete authorization evidence. This prompt states principles, not
 * case law: before adding a case-specific rule, fold it into an existing
 * principle (a smoke test ratchets the total length).
