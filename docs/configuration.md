# Configuration Reference

Configuration lives under `dsh-auto-review:` in the settings document. Most changes apply immediately without a restart. The minimum configuration is the master switch:

```yaml
dsh-auto-review:
  enabled: true
```

## Choosing a reviewer

### Use the agent's current model

Leave `baseURL` empty to use the agent's current model as the reviewer. Harness supplies its existing credentials, so no endpoint or key configuration is required.

In this configuration, the agent and reviewer use the same model. They can make the same interpretation error on the same user instruction. Interactive use still has the human approval path available; unattended deployments should use a separate reviewer.

### Use a separate endpoint

Set `baseURL` to an OpenAI-compatible `chat/completions` endpoint and configure `model` and a key. For unattended deployments, use a reviewer from a different provider or model family than the agent when possible.

An external endpoint receives the reviewer policy, the pending request's tool name and raw arguments, user messages, recent agent activity, summaries of tool results, the workspace path, and the sandbox mode. File content is not sent by default. It is included only when `factFinding.content.enabled` is enabled and the reviewer requests `inspect_text_file`.

Tool arguments can contain sensitive values such as paths, URLs, or code. Configure an endpoint that is permitted to receive that data.

Keys are resolved in this order: `apiKey` → `apiKeyEnv` → `apiKeyFile`. `apiKeyEnv` reads a process environment variable. `apiKeyFile` reads the first non-comment `NAME=value` line. It does not parse shell syntax such as `export` or quoted values; use an unquoted value. If no key resolves, the request follows `denyOnReviewerError`.

### The systemone protocol (decision-model reviewer)

`protocol: systemone` turns each review into ONE System One decision call (POST `{baseURL}/systemone`), for decision APIs like TypeSafe Jev and SiliconFlow's systemone. Notable properties:

- One call answers two parallel choice questions: `decision` (allow/deny) and `risk` (low/medium/high/critical); `state.policy` carries the full guardian policy and `state.request` carries exactly the structured review input the chat path sends.
- The typed answers are deterministically synthesized into verdict JSON and go through the same strict parser as chat output: critical risk always normalizes to deny; a malformed answer shape is a reviewer error (default `unavailable`, fail closed).
- `systemone.confidenceThreshold` (default 0.6, range [0.5, 1]): a decision answer below the threshold is forced to deny and counted as a normal denial — it means "ambiguous evidence", not an infrastructure failure, so it never routes through `denyOnReviewerError`.
- `reason` is a deterministic statistical synopsis (e.g. `systemone Kev-4b — decision allow, p(allow)=0.920, confidence=0.920; risk low`). Decision APIs do not generate natural-language explanations; use the chat protocol if you want prose rejection reasons.
- Empty `baseURL` resolves to `https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1` (free during Alpha until 2026-10-08); empty `model` resolves to `Kev-4b` (provisional). Switching to TypeSafe: `baseURL: https://api.typesafe.ai/v1`, `model: jev-latest`.
- `maxTokens` / `thinking` have no effect on the systemone path (decision APIs have neither); request timeouts are still governed by `timeoutMs`.
- Egress matches an external chat endpoint: user messages, tool names and arguments, execution context, workspace root and sandbox mode; file contents are not sent by default.

## thinking

`thinking` only controls whether the reviewer request tries to disable reasoning. It does not affect how authorization is interpreted. Leave it at the default unless you specifically want to disable reviewer reasoning:

```yaml
dsh-auto-review:
  reviewer:
    thinking: off
```

`default` sends no extra reasoning-control parameter and leaves the behavior to the model or provider. The effect of `off` depends on how the reviewer is called:

- When `reviewer.baseURL` is configured, the plugin calls `${baseURL}/chat/completions` directly and adds `thinking: { type: disabled }` to the request body. This is a DeepSeek extension. If the endpoint does not accept that field, keep `thinking: default`; otherwise the reviewer request may fail.
- When `reviewer.baseURL` is empty, the reviewer follows the current session model. If the current provider is `deepseek-official`, `off` is passed through the Harness LLM layer as `reasoningEffort: off`.
- When the reviewer follows a session model from another provider, the plugin currently sends no additional reasoning override, so that provider keeps its default behavior.

In every case, allow/deny is read only from the reviewer's final text answer. Chain-of-thought, reasoning blocks, and `reasoning_content` are never treated as authorization.

## Policy

### Requests visible to the reviewer

The reviewer handles only approval requests that can be matched to an exact tool call. The request's `callId` must match a `tool/call` event. If it cannot be matched, the request is `rejected`. An approval request without a `callId` is not treated as a tool request and continues to the next answerer.

`maxInputChars` limits the pending request itself. An oversized request is `rejected` before the reviewer is called and is not truncated. The latest user message is also never truncated because its later text may narrow or revoke authorization. If that message cannot fit within the context budget, the request is `rejected` before reviewer execution.

Reviewer context is divided into trusted and untrusted input. Only user messages can authorize an action. Assistant text, tool calls, and tool results provide event context only. Tool results can contain prompt injection, so the default context includes only their length and sha256 summary. With `rawToolResults: true`, up to 400 characters from each tool result may also be included. Newer user messages take precedence over older ones; a later revocation or narrowing overrides earlier authorization. Older messages that exceed the per-message limit are represented by sha256-only placeholders, which cannot authorize actions.

### Allow rules

`allowRules` is a direct allow path that runs before the reviewer. A matching request immediately returns `allowed-once`; the reviewer is not called. Only put operations here that you are willing to approve automatically.

For example, this rule applies only to plain approval requests for the `bash` tool and allows operation strings that begin with `git status` or `git diff`:

```yaml
dsh-auto-review:
  policy:
    allowRules:
      - tool: bash
        operations:
          - "git status"
          - "git diff"
        escalationTarget: ''
```

`tool` must exactly match the actual tool name. `operations` checks the tool arguments in the order `command`, `operation`, then `script`, takes the first string field it finds, and performs a literal string-prefix match. There is no shell parsing and no token boundary. For example, `git status` also matches `git status --short`, so avoid broad prefixes such as `git`.

`escalationTarget: ''` makes the rule plain-approval only, meaning the tool arguments do not contain a non-empty `sandbox_permissions`. A plain rule may omit `operations` or leave it empty, but doing so allows every plain approval request for that exact tool, including calls with no `command`, `operation`, or `script` field. Leave it empty only when that is actually what you want.

To allow a `workspace-write` escalation, define a separate escalation rule:

```yaml
dsh-auto-review:
  policy:
    allowRules:
      - tool: bash
        operations:
          - "mkdir -p ./dist"
        escalationTarget: workspace-write
```

This rule matches only requests with `sandbox_permissions: workspace-write`, and the operation string must begin with one of the listed prefixes. It does not match plain approvals. Escalation rules must have at least one operation prefix. `escalationTarget` may only be empty or `workspace-write`, so `danger-full-access` cannot be granted through `allowRules`. Regular expressions are not supported.

If no rule matches, the request continues to the reviewer. When `policy.tools` is non-empty, the plugin filters by that list first. A tool not listed in `policy.tools` never reaches either `allowRules` or the reviewer.

### Reviewer errors

`denyOnReviewerError: true` is the default. Reviewer call or result-processing errors return `unavailable`, so the request fails closed. `unavailable` does not count as a circuit-breaker denial. Set `denyOnReviewerError: false` to pass these requests to the next answerer.

The following cases use `denyOnReviewerError`: endpoint or session-model failure, an empty final answer, a second unparsable reply after one retry, a fact request when fact finding or content inspection is disabled, and a fact request that exceeds the configured limits.

A `critical` request cannot be allowed by the reviewer; an allow verdict on a critical request is converted to deny.

### Circuit breaker

The circuit breaker is scoped to the current turn. A deny increments the consecutive-denial count and records a deny in the rolling window. `allow` and `unavailable` reset the consecutive-denial count and record a non-denial. `unavailable` therefore breaks a consecutive-denial streak but does not count as a denial.

With the defaults, the breaker trips after three consecutive denials or ten denials in the latest fifty approval outcomes. The rolling window counts approval outcomes, not reviewer calls. Direct `allowRules` grants and pre-review `rejected` outcomes also update breaker state.

`action: cancel` injects the breaker notice and cancels the current turn. `action: inject` injects the notice without cancelling. `action: off` performs neither action.

### Fact finding

The reviewer can return `need_fact` to request local information before issuing a verdict. Across `maxRounds` round trips, it may make at most `factFinding.maxFacts` queries. Available tools are fixed: `inspect_path`, `inspect_directory`, `inspect_file_metadata`, `inspect_git_remote`, `inspect_git_status`, and, when enabled, `inspect_text_file`. Credentials are stripped from `inspect_git_remote` results.

These tools are restricted to the workspace. Paths are checked with realpath containment. Requests outside the workspace are refused without returning metadata such as whether a file exists. The queries do not use a shell, network access, or escalation. The only subprocess is git, run with fsmonitor disabled and an empty `hooksPath`.

`inspect_text_file` is the only fact-finding tool that can send workspace file content to the reviewer, and it is disabled by default. When enabled, it remains workspace-scoped and refuses binary files, files over `maxBytes`, and known sensitive paths including `.env`, `.ssh/`, `.aws/`, `.kube/`, `.npmrc`, `.pypirc`, `.docker/`, `credentials.*`, `secrets.*`, and key material. A static path list cannot identify every sensitive file, so content access remains opt-in.

A fact request made while fact finding is disabled, an `inspect_text_file` request made while content inspection is disabled, or a request beyond `maxRounds` / `maxFacts` follows `denyOnReviewerError`.

## Configuration loading

Valid settings updates apply immediately. Invalid updates are rejected and the last known-good configuration remains active.

If settings service registration fails, the plugin uses the validated configuration supplied when it was loaded. If a settings read fails before any valid settings configuration has been read, that approval request continues to the next answerer. After a valid settings configuration has been read, later read failures keep the last known-good configuration.

Updating plugin code still requires restarting the running profile.

## Audit

When enabled, audit records are appended to `audit.path`. Raw tool input is omitted by default and represented by `inputSha256`; `includeToolInput: true` also stores the original tool input.

Audit write failures are logged and not thrown. They do not change the approval result.

## Composer commands

### /auto-review

With no arguments, `/auto-review` toggles the feature. `on` and `off` set the state; `status` prints the effective configuration, including what an external reviewer receives. A settings update failure is returned as a command error.

### /approve

`/approve` lists the ten most recent denials in the current session. `/approve N` displays one record's tool, directory, complete arguments, risk, reason, and fingerprint. Displaying the record does not authorize anything.

After `/approve N` has been displayed, `/approve N confirm` permits one retry of that exact action. The approval is sent to the reviewer as trusted evidence, and the retry still requires a reviewer verdict. `critical` actions remain denied. Records are kept in memory, up to ten per session, and are cleared when the current profile process exits.
